```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Set up regression models

```{r}
bears <- read.csv(file="BEARS.csv",header = TRUE)
```

# NECK
## Model LENGTH ~ NECK    

```{r}
simp <- lm(LENGTH~NECK,data=bears)
plot(LENGTH~NECK,data=bears)
abline(simp)
summary.lm(simp)
```

## now predict the length of a bear who has a neck of 17, 22 and 26


```{r}
new <- data.frame(NECK=bears$NECK [c(5, 15, 23)])
predict(simp,new,se.fit=TRUE)
```

# HEADWTH
## Model LENGTH ~ HEADWTH 


## Surely there is another variable that can better predict LENGTH than NECK. Find one and compare its performance to that of neck by it value of Adjusted-Rsquared (bigger is better).
